    <p>The company’s founder was Frank Hornby, who lived from 1863 to 1936.
He applied for a patent for a new toy called Meccano in 1901.
He then introduced toy trains in 1920.
Hornby Trains were an instant success and the company was quick to introduce more engines and accessories.
Model production stopped during the Second World War, when the factories made wartime equipment instead. But they soon returned.
Hornby came under increasing pressure from rival company Tri-ang Railways, who had developed plastic bodied trains. By the 1960’s the companies had merged.
Changes taking place on British Railways at this time brought several new styles that were eagerly modelled by Hornby.
Today, the range of rail companies in the UK provides a further choice of new and diverse models, with a range of more than 650 items from Hornby alone.
